# UserVault

**UserVault** is a simple user management application built to learn and practice the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** stack. The application allows administrators to manage user data, including creating, editing, deleting, and viewing user information. It also utilizes **Redux Toolkit** for state management, **JWT** for authentication, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Cloudinary** for image uploads, and **Bcrypt** for password encryption.
